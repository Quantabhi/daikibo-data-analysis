# Daikibo Data Analysis Project

This project includes two real-world business analysis tasks completed using Tableau and Excel, focused on factory telemetry data and gender pay equality.

## ✅ Task 1: Factory Machine Downtime Analysis (Tableau)

📊 **Goal**: Identify which factory had the highest machine downtime and which devices caused the most issues.

📍 **Steps:**
- Analyzed machine telemetry data across 4 factories (Japan, Germany, China).
- Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with:
  - Total downtime per factory
  - Total downtime per device type
  - Filtering enabled by factory

## ✅ Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Audit (Excel)

🔍 **Goal**: Classify employee job roles based on an equality score to detect pay inequality across factories.

📍 **Steps:**
- Used a pre-processed Excel file with job roles and equality scores.
- Created a new column `Equality Class` based on the following logic:
  - **Fair**: Score between -10 and +10
  - **Unfair**: Score between -20 and -11 or 11 to 20
  - **Highly Discriminative**: Score >20 or <-20
- Applied conditional formatting to visually highlight categories.
